              <p>2018 has not been a smooth sailing year for scientists, with the 2018 heat wave puzzling scientists all over the world, and leading to numerous wildfires and droughts across the globe, such as in places like Australia, California, and the United States.</p>
              <p>Singapore is heating twice as fast as the rest of the world at 0.25&deg;C per decade. While that might seem minute, Singapore’s maximum daily temperatures could reach 35&deg;C to 37&deg;C by 2100 if carbon emissions continue to rise at the same rate, hence emphasizing on the importance of curbing carbon emissions.<sup class="citation" /></p>

              <p>In fact, National Geographic has mentioned that 2018 was one of the most active hurricane seasons on record, and speculations are that a warming climate may be making these storms more frequent and more intense.<sup class="citation"></sup></p>

              <h4 id="section4">Factors of Global Warming</h4>
              <p>Therefore, the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) meeting at Incheon, Korea has concluded that “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” is required to limit “global warming to 1.5°C” and this would give “clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems in ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society”.<sup class="citation"></sup></p>
              <p>Here’s a brief rundown of what global warming actually constitutes.</p>
              <p>The main factor causing global warming and rapid climate change is large concentrations of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the Earth's <mark>greenhouse effect</mark>.</p>
              <div class="card single-card">
                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>The sun provides light energy which is absorbed by the Earth and warms the Earth up. The <mark>greenhouse effect</mark> is the phenomenon whereby greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub> trap the outgoing heat from Earth, preventing it from escaping.</p>
                  The greenhouse effect is vital for survival by keeping the Earth warm, but profligate burning of fossil fuels by humans has led to a large amount of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere. Excessive amounts of heat are trapped and re-radiated on Earth, leading to <mark>global warming</mark>.

              <div class="row card-row">

                      <h6>Approximately 77% of greenhouse gases are CO2 emissions, as observed from this pie chart.<sup class="citation"></sup> This has also been reiterated in the IPCC Report 2018, that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions constitute 78% of greenhouse gas emissions from 2000-2010.<sup class="citation"></sup></h6>
